# To make this script runnable for a quick test:
# 1. Make sure `scraper.py` is in the same directory.
# 2. You can create an empty file named `dummy.txt` in the same directory.
# 3. Change `hypothetical_file_path = "path/to/your/document.pdf"`
#    to `hypothetical_file_path = "dummy.txt"`.
# 4. Run `python run_scraper.py` from your terminal in this directory.
#    You should see output indicating it tried to process `dummy.txt`.
